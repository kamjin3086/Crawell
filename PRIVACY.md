### Introduction
We value your privacy and data security. This Policy explains what information **Crawell** ("we", "our") collects, how we use it, how it is stored or deleted, and which rights you have regarding that information.

### 1. Information We Collect
We only collect data that is strictly necessary:
* **Account data** (optional) – your e-mail address, display name and auth tokens whenever you voluntarily register or log-in.
* **Usage data** – aggregated feature counters and crash logs **without any personally identifiable information (PII)**. These are used solely to improve stability and user experience.
* **Page content** (optional) – when you actively click **“Extract”** or enable *Auto-Extract*, the extension parses the current page **locally inside your browser**. No page content will be uploaded unless you explicitly share or synchronise it.

### 2. How We Use Data
We process data only for legitimate purposes:
1. To deliver core features (content extraction, translation, AI chat, etc.).
2. To secure and maintain the service, debug and fix issues.
3. To analyse anonymised usage data and improve performance, UI and UX.
4. To send important notices you have opted-in for.

**We never sell, rent or disclose your personal data to third parties** without your explicit consent, unless required by law.

### 3. Storage & Security
* All settings are stored locally via the browser `storage.local` API and never leave your device.
* All traffic initiated by the extension is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS/TLS channels.
* We follow the principles of data minimisation and least privilege and perform periodic access audits.

### 4. Data Retention & Deletion
* **Local data** – you can wipe all cached data and settings at any time via **Settings → Data Management → Clear All Data**.
* **Account data** – to delete server-side records (e.g. credit history) or close your account, please contact us via the channels below; we will process the request within **7 business days**.

### 5. Your Rights & Contact Us
If you have any questions, comments or complaints about this Policy, feel free to [open an Issue](https://github.com/kamjin3086/Crawell/issues/new) or reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/stDBJE8tva). We will respond as soon as possible.
