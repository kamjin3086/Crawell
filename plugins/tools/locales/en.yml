  faqTitle: FAQ
  faq:
    q1:
      q: Why does the Extract button do nothing?
      a: Some sites use lazy-loading or cross-origin images. Scroll down to load images before extracting, or enable "Auto Extract" in settings.
    q2:
      q: ZIP download failed / file is corrupted?
      a: Make sure no extension blocks downloads, or switch to individual download mode. Large batches may hit browser memory limits.
    q3:
      q: Markdown image links are inaccessible?
      a: For offline reading, enable "Download ZIP" so images are saved locally and paths converted to relative links.
  coreItems:
    img: "Image collecting: automatically extract all images and classify them as icons, thumbnails, content or HD images; supports format filter, batch download & conversion."
    markdown: "Markdown conversion: convert article main content to clean Markdown; perfect for Notion, Obsidian etc."
